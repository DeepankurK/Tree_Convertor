Use this file to keep log of the steps you are performing. 

1. Input from user added in form of choices and paths has been added.
2. For the conversion codes, I thought I was enough in the form of Phylo->Mut->Clonal->Phylo( 3 nistead of 6 conversions) but after seeing the metrics this might not be possible therefore all 6 conversion codes have to be written.



#TO BE ADDED:-
0. 3 more conversion codes denoting a anti cycle.
1. command line arguments
2. metrics comparison for trees.
